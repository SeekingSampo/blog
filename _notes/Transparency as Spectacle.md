My friend recently asked me why the music industry doesn't use blockchain technology to guarantee artist royalties. I'll answer that, but while I do, consider a reframing of the question to: "Who gets to extract value from creative work?" 

Let's consider some of the implicit assumptions in the original question. 
1. The music industry is a unified actor
2. Use implies rights violations happen at discrete trackable moments
3. Artist royalties presumes programmatic definitions of valid use
4. Guarantee implies that technical verification equates to enforcement
5. Blockchain technology implies that decentralization solves trust

The blockchain assumption is actually the most straightforward to refute. The central premise of blockchain technology is that by decentralizing a ledger and verifying it through communal consensus one can prevent bad actors from manipulating the record. This means that ledgers can be managed without requiring a trusted intermediary. However, in the context of the music industry, musicians and music companies literally need courts and lawyers and infrastructure to interpret and enforce rights.  Music rights are full of edge cases that require human judgment.

We already KNOW YourMusicStreamingService.com pays garbage rates. we already KNOW the majors take most of the money. Putting that on chain just gives musicians an immutable record of getting screwed. The push for "transparency" in music industry finances is actually a form of spectacle. Creating the illusion of accountability while obscuring the actual mechanisms of power. Promised transparency without agency, verification without power, and most ironically, trustless systems for problems that fundamentally require trust. 

The implication of the guarantee of royalties on a collective ledger betrays its own impossibility; presuming that perfect accounting creates perfect power, when in reality the ledger just becomes another tool for capital to set the terms of extraction. The music industry already has perfect information about who owns what. they just don't care. 

Valid use itself is politically determined. Streaming destroyed the very concept of discrete "plays" that traditional royalty systems were built on. We still pretend that listens can be counted when the whole notion of a listen has become philosophically incoherent. Streaming platforms have broken the notion of the music listening experience into a series of micro-expereinces that don't have clear boundaries. 

When the music industry is treated as a unified actor, we obscure how streaming platforms have actually achieved what the old cartels could only dream of: the total subsumption of music into pure commodity. The traditional industry maintained power through artificial scarcity and controlled distribution; streaming achieves hegemony through unlimited access that paradoxically strengthens central control. By atomizing the very concept of a listen into algorithmic micro-experiences, platforms don't just extract value - they redefine value itself. what appears as democratization of access is actually the final victory of exchange value over use value, where even the attempt to "fix" royalty systems through blockchain only further reifies music as property. The industry is achieving exactly what capital demands: the transformation of art into pure circulation divorced from production.

Care about your art enough to refuse its commodification.
